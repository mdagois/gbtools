# 1. Add at least one project to the 'projects' variable.
# For this tutorial, we add one single project.
projects = tutorial

# 2. Add at least one configuration to the 'configurations' variable.
# For this tutorial, we define two rather common configurations.
configurations = release debug

# 3. Specify the build directory.
# All files generated by GBBS are stored in the build directory.
# The directory MUST be dedicated to GGBS, as GBBS will delete files
# as necessary (i.e. do not put any important files in the build directory)
build_directory = build

# 4. Add source files to each project.
# We only have one single project, 'tutorial', so we use the variable
# 'tutorial_sources'.
tutorial_sources = src/main.rgbasm

# 5. [Optional] Add compilation options for each configuration.
# This step shows how straightforward it is to define compile options for
# each configuration.
# It is also possible to define compile options for a given project (i.e. tutorial)
# or a combination of project and configuration (i.e. tutorial_release).
debug_compile_options = -DBUILD_DEBUG
release_compile_options = -DBUILD_RELEASE

# 6. [Optional] Add link options for the 'tutorial' project.
# As for compile options, it is possible to define link options for each
# configuration, project or project/combination combination.
tutorial_link_options = --dmg --tiny

# 7. Include GGBS.
# GGBS automatically generates the rules to build the projects.
include ../gbbs.mk

# 8. Type `make help` to see all targets.
# 9. Check the GBBS reference to learn about other options.
